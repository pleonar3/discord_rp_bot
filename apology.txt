You're in here.

I know that much.

What do you want?

If this is about the things I've done in the past, look I'm really sorry.

I've been spending a lot of time thinking about the things I've done and said. I've made many mistakes in my life. I showed no fucks given about anyone or anything. I took everything for granted, and didn't even think twice. I screwed myself over despite all the legs up I had been given.

I was a fool. 

What do you want from me?



I cannot improve unless I am allowed to. If I improve, maybe I'll be able to give back to the world and right the wrongs I've done. If I cannot, then I can only continue to make the world a worse place.

Whoever you are. Tell me what I've done to you, and tell me if there's anything I might be able to do to start making it better.
